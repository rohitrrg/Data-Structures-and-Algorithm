"""
List is a Pythonâ€™s built-in data structure that can be used as a queue.
Instead of enqueue() and dequeue(), append() and pop() function is used. 
However, lists are quite slow for this purpose because inserting or deleting
an element at the beginning requires shifting all of the other elements by one,
requiring O(n) time.
